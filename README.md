# LSTM-RNN-Model-For-Univariate-Time-Series-Forecasting

This is a kaggle problem where, the data contains a year and a month and no. of passengers travelled, the task is to predict the number of international airline passengers. The data ranges from January 1949 to December 1960, or 12 years, with 144 observations. we have Used LSTM
 to forecast the predictions.
